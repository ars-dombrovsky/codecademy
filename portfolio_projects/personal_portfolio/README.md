# Arseny Dombrovsky – Personal Portfolio

## Description:
This portfolio website was created as part of my full stack web development learning journey. It serves as a space to showcase my work, highlight my skills and certifications, and allow visitors to get in touch with me.

Beyond that, this project gave me the opportunity to practice responsive design, work with Flexbox layouts, explore accessibility features, and implement interactive elements using JavaScript — all while focusing on writing clean, maintainable code.

## Features:
- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- Project showcase with images, descriptions, and technology tags  
- Contact form for direct communication  
- Links to social media profiles  
- JavaScript-powered interactivity (e.g., dynamic elements, form handling)  
- Accessibility considerations using semantic HTML and best practices  
- Clean, modern layout using CSS Flexbox  
- Hover effects for buttons and project cards

## How to Use:
To view the portfolio locally, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser — no installation or build tools required.
